## Commit Guidelines

File name and commit message formats that have been followed:

### File Name Format

The commit file name should match the LeetCode problem number. For example:

```
1.TwoSum.cpp
2.AddTwoNumbers.cpp
```

### Commit Message Format

The commit message should follow the format: `Problem Number - [Problem NO.]`.

For example, if you are committing the solution for Problem 1, "Two Sum," your commit message should be:

```
Problem Number - 1
```
